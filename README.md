## Description

This project showcases an NTP‑synchronized clock built using the JC3248W535C display module and fully powered by **ESPHome**. The device retrieves accurate time from NTP servers, renders it on a 3.2" TFT display, and integrates seamlessly with **Home Assistant** for monitoring and automation.

The firmware is written entirely in YAML and includes:
- real‑time NTP synchronization
- custom layout for time, date, and weekday
- support for custom fonts and image assets
- smooth visual transitions and clean UI elements
- optional Home Assistant sensors and data integration

This repository contains all required resources: ESPHome configuration, display assets, fonts and setup instructions. The project is designed to be easy to reproduce, customize, and extend.
